# Java Design Patterns (GOF)

Classic design patterns implemented in Java that I used to prepare for my OCMJEA6 certification.

To run this code simply:

1. Clone the repo
2. Import as composed Maven project into your favorite IDE
3. **Install [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/)**
4. Run Main classes for each pattern you want to

## Patterns

Each design pattern code is stored within it's own Maven module.

In this exercise I implemented the following patterns with simple scenarios.

- Abstract Factory
- Adapter
- Builder
- Chain-of-responsibility
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Factory Method
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- Prototype
- Proxy
- Singleton
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor
