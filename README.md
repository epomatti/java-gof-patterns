# Java Design Patterns (GOF)

Classic design patterns implemented in Java that I used to prepare for my OCMJEA6 certification.

To run this code simply:

1. Clone the repo
2. Import as composed Maven project into your favorite IDE
3. Run Main classes for each pattern you want to

Each design pattern code is stored within it's own Maven module.
